## (React Based) Fantasy Football PPR vs Dynasty Rankings: make your own table
Glitch:https://a4-stryder-crouse.glitch.me/

This application provides each user with a table they can update to compare football players ranking between PPR(Points Per Reception) and Dynasty formats.

**Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?**
In my opinion developing in React made the project easier to develop as it
1.  Made the code base cleaner by allowing copy and past html elements to be replaced with components.
2. Combined the functionality and visual output together in one file, making it easier to remember what functions control what on a page.
3. Allowed for a more intuitive method for creating dynamic html elements compared to bare bones js.
4. Only con was adjusting to the new program style.
